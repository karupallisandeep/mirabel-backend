## 🎮 **How to Deploy (CEO Dashboard)**

### **Method 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)**
When anyone commits code to the main branch, it automatically deploys!

**How it works:**
1. **Developer commits code** → Pushes to GitHub
2. **GitHub Actions triggers** → Starts deployment automatically
3. **Full deployment runs** → Same process as manual (5-10 minutes)
4. **You get notified** → Email notification when complete

**You don't need to do anything - it just works!**

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Zero effort** - Happens automatically
- ✅ **Always up to date** - Every code change deploys
- ✅ **No delays** - Deploys immediately after commit
- ✅ **Consistent** - Same process every time

### **Method 2: Manual Deployment (When Needed)**

1. **Go to GitHub:** https://github.com/your-username/your-repo
2. **Click:** "Actions" tab
3. **Click:** "Manual Deploy (CEO Dashboard)"
4. **Click:** "Run workflow" button
5. **Choose options:**
   - **Deployment Type:** "full" (recommended)
   - **Environment:** "production"
6. **Click:** "Run workflow"
7. **Wait:** 5-10 minutes
8. **Check:** Green checkmark = Success ✅
