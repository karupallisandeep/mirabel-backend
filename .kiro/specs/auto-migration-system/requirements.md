# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement an automatic migration creation system that detects schema changes during deployment and automatically creates migration files with descriptive names, eliminating the need for manual migration creation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want schema changes to automatically create migration files during deployment, so that I don't need to manually create migrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema.prisma is modified AND deployment is triggered THEN the system SHALL automatically detect schema changes
2. WHEN schema changes are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a migration file with a descriptive name
3. WHEN migration file is created THEN the system SHALL apply the migration to the database
4. WHEN migration is successful THEN the system SHALL continue with normal deployment process

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CEO, I want the deployment process to handle all schema changes automatically, so that I don't need to understand migration workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run deployment THEN the system SHALL handle schema changes transparently
2. WHEN schema changes exist THEN the deployment SHALL NOT fail due to missing migrations
3. WHEN deployment completes THEN all schema changes SHALL be applied to the database
4. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN I SHALL receive confirmation that schema was updated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want migration files to be automatically committed to version control, so that all schema changes are tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration file is created THEN the system SHALL automatically commit it to Git
2. WHEN migration is committed THEN the commit message SHALL be descriptive
3. WHEN multiple schema changes exist THEN each change SHALL create a separate migration
4. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic migration names to be descriptive and meaningful, so that I can understand what each migration does.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is auto-created THEN the name SHALL describe the schema change
2. WHEN adding tables THEN migration name SHALL include "add_[table_name]"
3. WHEN modifying columns THEN migration name SHALL include "modify_[table]_[column]"
4. WHEN removing elements THEN migration name SHALL include "remove_[element_name]"
5. WHEN changes are complex THEN migration name SHALL be "auto_schema_update_[timestamp]"

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a deployment system, I want to fallback to db push if migration creation fails, so that deployments don't break due to migration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automatic migration creation fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to prisma db push
2. WHEN fallback is used THEN the system SHALL log a warning message
3. WHEN fallback succeeds THEN deployment SHALL continue normally
4. WHEN both migration and fallback fail THEN deployment SHALL fail with clear error message
